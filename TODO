# - create router (VPC)
# - create 1+$NONETS (1+2) nets -- $NONETS is normally the # of AZs
# - create 1+$NONETS subnets
# - create security groups
# - create virtual IP (for outbound SNAT via JumpHosts)
# - create SSH keys
# - create $NOAZS JumpHost VMs by
#   a) creating disks (from image)
#   b) creating ports
#   c) creating VMs
# - associating a floating IP to each Jumphost
# - configuring the virtIP as default route
# - JumpHosts do SNAT for outbound traffic and port forwarding for inbound
#   (this used to require SUSE images with SFW2-snat package to work, but now
#    should work on most images, assuming iptables rules can be configured)
# - create N internal VMs striped over the nets and AZs by
#   a) creating disks (from image) -- if option -d is not used
#   b) creating a port -- if option -P is not used
#   c) creating VM (from volume or from image, dep. on -d)
#   (Steps a and c take long, so we do many in parallel and poll for progress)
#   d) do some property changes to VMs
# - after everything is complete, we wait for the VMs to be up
# - we ping them, log in via ssh and see whether they can ping to the outside world (dns.google)
